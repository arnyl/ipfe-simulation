# IPFE Simulation

This directory contains a Python-based simulation of **Inner Product Functional Encryption (IPFE)**.  
It is designed for learning and experimentation purposes, implementing core concepts such as encryption, decryption, and discrete logarithm recovery using multiple strategies (Baby-Step Giant-Step, Pollard's Kangaroo, etc.).

> **Note:** This is a simulation â€” not a production-ready implementation. All parameters used (including the modulus, generator, and vector bounds) are small and for demonstration only.

### ðŸ”§ Parameters
- `p` is a small prime modulus (e.g. 1009, 1019, etc.)
- `g` is a generator for the multiplicative group â„¤â‚š*
- `ptx` is the plaintext vector (e.g. `[3, 2, 1]`)
- `y` is the function vector for which the decryption yields âŸ¨x, yâŸ©
- `r` is random for encryption randomness
- All inner products are kept **below `p`** to ensure correctness of decryption

### ðŸ§ª Features
- Key generation (`msk`, `mpk`)
- Functional encryption of vectors
- Recovery of âŸ¨x, yâŸ© from ciphertext using known secret key
- Discrete log recovery via fallback strategy (brute force â†’ BSGS â†’ Pollard)
